passing routes params
using query params

Need to put most specific route first ahead of dynamic routes like :
router.get('/products/delete');
router.get('/products/:productId')

using dynamic query params to edit products:
http://localhost:3000/admin/edit-product/12345?edit=true

working ways::
route >> views >> controller >> model

SQL Database::
core characteristics :
1. Data Schema => All Data(in a table) has to fit!
2. Data Relations => one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

NoSQL Databases::
Collections named as tablename in sql db.
Documents named as data inside the tables in sql db.
Documents are schemaless that means they have no proper/strict structure.
No/few relation/connections with collections. need to duplicate data in the collections.
Need to change the updated data in multiple places in each collections.
Advantages::
No need to join multiple tables together.
No need to add complex query/long code to manipulate the data which can impact performance issue.

A) SQL IS GOOD WHEN:
if you are storing where the relations are really important and where you want to have a split up across tables and where you want to have strong schemas, SQL can be perfect,
also not every part of your data is accessed multiple times per second.
You can have parts of your application where you manage general data.

Regarding the scaling, it's important that horizontal scaling often is very difficult or even impossible due to the way SQL works.

In general in SQL we use schemas, we also have relations,these are two core characteristics and data is typically distributed across many many tables which are then connected through relations.



B) NoSQL IS GOOD WHEN:
NoSQL is schemaless and has only a few relations if at all, the data is typically not distributed
across multiple collections but instead we work with merged or nested documents in an existing document, though we of course also have a couple of collections for the different features of our application typically. With NoSQL, horizontal scaling is easier

With NoSQL, horizontal scaling is easier,still something where you have to know what you do but there are cloud providers which do that for us so we don't have to know the ins and outs of that and in general, due to the way it works with less connections and so on, this is possible. And therefore we also get great performance for mass read and write requests and
NoSQL can be very performant in an application with high throughput.

C) Installation MySQL :: mysql site > download > MySQL Community (GPL) Downloads > MySQL Community Server,MySQL Workbench,MySQL Installer for Windows > MySQL Server 8.0.41 & MySQL Workbench 8.0.41

D) npm install --save mysql2

E) With sequelize, we no need to write complex query for fetching or inserting data from DB.
F) Sequelize is an object relational mapping library which simply means it does all the heavy lifting, all the SQL code behind the scenes for us and maps it into javascript objects with convenience methods which we can call to execute that behind the scenes SQL code so that we never have to write SQL code on our own.
G)We can then instantiate these models, so these classes so to say, we can execute the constructor functions or use utility methods to create let's say a new user object based on that model so we have a connection here and we can then run queries on that.
That could be that we save a new user but it could also be that we find all users as an example and here again, this always relates back to our model which we define with sequelize. And we can also associate our models.

core concepts of Sequelize::
Models ==> eg. User, Product
Instances ==> const user = User.build()
Queries ==> User.findAll()
Associations ==> User.hasMany(Product)

To Install Sequelize::
npm install --save mysql2
npm install --save sequelize

sequelize package is An ORM, or Object Relational Mapper.

Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

MongoDB::
It uses JSON(BSON) ie Binary Json to save the data.

Relation options::
Embedded/Nested document : means data inside data like nested json.
References: lots of data duplication.

NoSQL Characteristics::
1. No data schema (no structure required)
2. Fewer data relations

MongoDB Atlas:: userid: chinmays password: EvhBfpV8JX2Lylev
userid: cadmin password: uCVheW93M151p5kg

connection string:: mongodb+srv://chinmays:<db_password>@cluster0.bcmob3z.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
mongodb+srv://chinmays:<db_password>@cluster0.bcmob3z.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

legacy cs:: mongodb://chinmays:<db_password>@ac-fhqoalq-shard-00-00.bcmob3z.mongodb.net:27017,ac-fhqoalq-shard-00-01.bcmob3z.mongodb.net:27017,ac-fhqoalq-shard-00-02.bcmob3z.mongodb.net:27017/?replicaSet=atlas-12fkkf-shard-0&ssl=true&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

npm install --save mongodb

Installation noSQL s/w:: mongodb compass 

To connect with mongodb create a sample user first..

To configure .env file for DB connection safely::
npm install dotenv 

Tools used:: mySql, sequalize (mySQL ORM) Object Relational Mapping library, 
	     MongoDB, Mongoose (MongoDB ODM) Object Document Mapping library

Mongoose core concept::  (similar to sequelize of mysql)
    Schemas & Models ==> ie User, Product
    Instances        ==> const user = new User;
    Queries          ==> User.find()

pkg installed :: 
npm install --save mongoose
